# MCQ Generator using Ollama (Local LLM)

This project is a **local MCQ (Multiple Choice Question) Generator** that creates a **question paper and a separate answer sheet** from an uploaded PDF document using a **locally running Large Language Model (LLM) via Ollama**.

The system works completely **offline after setup**, does not require any paid API keys, and ensures **data privacy**, making it suitable for academic, institutional, and personal use.
